## Bio
THE REPURPOSER

### Quote
"We want to be a one-stop shop for any piece of data that exists about Federal contracts."

## Design Implications
•   Use APIs make the data readily available  
•   Budgetary information at the summary level is not helpful. Data must be granular to provide real value to 
subscribers

## Goals & Tasks
•   Access data through outgoing API 
•   Add value through interpretation and analysis 
•   Create visualizations and identify trends
•    Resell data, such as:  What contracts have been awarded to whom, for how much, for how long, from what account. Which Federal agencies received increases and cuts. 

## Pain Points
•   Data quality is questionable: missing cells, 
typos in contractor names result in duplicate accounts, amounts sometimes differ from other source documents
•   Insufficient data granularity

## Attitudes & Motivations
•   Data needs to be accurate in order for us to sell it
•   Since it is all public data, we add value through data manipulation and analysis
•   US market data is just one piece of the 
puzzle; it should easily tie into the global equation
