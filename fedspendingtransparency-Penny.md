## Bio
THE BUDGET ANALYST

## Quote 
"I need clear insights into how an agency distributed last year’s allocation in order to review this year’s request."

## Design Implications
•   Move toward mandatory reporting of sub-awards (required fields)
•   Visualizations could identify or highlight data inconsistencies or variances in trends
•   To compensate for her vision loss, Penny zooms in views and often prints pages to review them up close
•   Support rich array of comparisons (see goals

## Goals & Tasks
•   Analyze agency budget requests
•   Compare budget requests with historical spending 
. Compare spending for like purposes across agencies 
•   Reconcile agency requests against the Congressional budget
•   Answer questions re: outlays vs. allocations

## Pain Points
•   Subcontract and sub-award information is poor
  - Program and agency listings are too broad
  - Cannot track to a meaningful expenditure level
•   Penny’s eyesight has weakened in recent 
years due to kidney disease so she has 
trouble reading small font sizes 

## Attitudes & Motivations
•   Needs every line of the President’s budget to stand up to Congressional inquiry—it must be both accurate and justifiable
•   Feels accountable to the American taxpayer
•   Conscious of the political environment and the level of Federal spending
