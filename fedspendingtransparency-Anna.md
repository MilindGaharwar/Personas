Bio - THE JOURNALIST

## Quote
"Watchdog journalism is a state of mind for the whole newspaper: Journalism that gives power to people."

## Goals & Tasks
•   Uncovers waste, fraud, or misuse in Federal spending
•   Pursues information related to recipients or Federal programs with attention to use of funding consistent with intended purpose, waste, data discrepancies, geographical distribution, etc.
•   Seeks answers based on a hunch or specific question; often topical and timely.

## Pain Points
•   Not enough detail on spending descriptions or financial recipients to conduct investigations.  In some instances, data does not go back far enough to tell the whole story
•   Stories are fragmented because of how child companies are split across records; difficult to get the big picture
•   Lack of transparency in primary sources of data displayed on USASpending

## Attitudes & Motivations
•   Transparency is paramount
•   Cares about serving the American public
•   Skeptical: will cross-reference with other systems that also document Federal spending
•   Will use other legal means to seek information (subpoenas, FOIA request, etc.)

## Design Implications

•   Link to primary sources or surface them easier (clear, 
traceable path back to data source for reconciliation)
•   Provide more detailed records of spending
•   Provide robust search and filter capabilities. Save 
searches
•   Make the financial reporting systems easier to  understand
