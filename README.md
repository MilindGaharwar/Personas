# Personas
A collection of Personas

We do really need to have a few we can pull from in a standardized, easy to modify format.

Useful to have a limited (3-5) number so that teams can get to know and empathize with the users. You don't want to have a different Persona for every type of disability. You want your team to be able to get to know them.
